#title: Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere (TAME): an experimentally-grounded framework for understanding diverse bodies and minds

Running title: Life as it can be, Mind as it can be

## Words:
> Intentional Stance; Hard Problem; broader implications for ethics; liquid brains; teleology
>
> radical changes of the material in which a given mind is implemented
> 
> the technology is advancing more rapidly than philosophical progress
> 
> minds are created de-novo, and not shaped by long selection pressures
> 
> advanced minds are in important ways generated in a continuous manner from much more _humble_ proto-cognitive systems
> 
> there is no such line, gradualist view, a theory of mind, one can simply train the pigeon
> 
> gene regulatory networks
> 
> Self: the ability to pursue goals, to own compound memories, and to serve as the center of gravity for credit assignment (be rewarded or punished)
> 
> a kind of goal-directedness permeates all of physics
> 
> spatio-temporal scal; “great transition” marker; the Unlimited Associative Learning marker; Active Inference
> 
> outlasting the lifetime of the agent itself – an important great transition
> 
> less “mechanism” and more decision-making, sensing/effector activity
> 
> tight, local homeostatic loops; the borders and scale; Theophile Bordeu’s “many little lives”;
> Somatic cognition; cognitive scaling;

## My comments:
> the correct level of agency with which to treat any system must be determined by experiments that reveal which kind of model and strategy provides the most efficient predictive and control capability over the system

_**Agency horseshoe?** We cannot control the Sun, it is hard [to confine photons to make a logic gate](https://youtu.be/pS1zAAD1nXI), but also it would be hard, if not impossible, to control an intelligent actor that has more agency then us_

> simple _homeostatic_ circuits

> _Homeostasis_, necessary for life, evolves into **allostasis**

_Contra: [V. Frankl's](notes/People#Victor%20Frankl) existentialism_ plus mistinguishers from `rot13` conversations with OpenAI's GPT-4

> a patchwork of agents (akin to Theophile Bordeu’s “many little lives” [138; 139]) that overlap with each other, and compete, communicate, and cooperate both horizontally (at their own level of organization) and vertically (with their component subunits and the super-Selves of which they are a part
