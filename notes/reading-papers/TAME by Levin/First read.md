# My comments:
> the correct level of agency with which to treat any system must be determined by experiments that reveal which kind of model and strategy provides the most efficient predictive and control capability over the system

_**Agency horseshoe?** We cannot control the Sun, it is hard [to confine photons to make a logic gate](https://youtu.be/pS1zAAD1nXI), but also it would be hard, if not impossible, to control an intelligent actor that has more agency then us_

> a patchwork of agents (akin to Theophile Bordeu’s “many little lives” [138; 139]) that overlap with each other, and compete, communicate, and cooperate both horizontally (at their own level of organization) and vertically (with their component subunits and the super-Selves of which they are a part

> meta-cognitive error correction mechanisms;

Could it be a form of [Humming coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code) in genetic information? What physical/chemical phenomena drives it?

> from protein pathways to power grids and beyond

How would it be conceptually different from game theoretical [Mechanism Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design) ?

> automated tools for estimation of agency

It is still not clear how estimate agencies that are stronger that the estimator's agency. What [complexity class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_class) does a problem of estimating agency has?

> the risks of negative uses of specific technologies

Apple's TV Foundation series has non-cannonical theme of the Imperial Cloning and opositions to it from a magor religion.

> These issues have been previously addressed in the context of evolutionary dynamics and game theory [235; 360; 361], but can be significantly expanded using the TAME framework

How exactly?

> one global homeostatic loop

_Misread_ it as "one global **holographic** loop". But why "loop"? Why not a "cycle"? Why not a "channel"? Is the state of _Homeostasis_ invariant to an external condition? [Multicriteria optimisation in Operation Research](https://c.coek.info/pdf-multicriteria-scheduling-.html) allows a Pareto set of **non-comparable** alternatives/options.
