# CRAFT Framework

A mnemonic document is smart preparation. You're right that some questions will be answered naturally, so having a flexible framework helps you adapt.

**Create a simple acronym like "CRAFT":**

- **C**ulture & team dynamics
- **R**ole specifics & daily work
- **A**dvancement & growth opportunities
- **F**lexibility & work-life balance
- **T**echnology & challenges

**Format suggestions:**

- Keep it to one page with bullet points
- Use your phone/computer during the call (it's expected)
- Leave space to jot down their answers
- Mark questions as "answered" so you don't repeat

**Smart approach:**

- Start with 2-3 prepared questions
- Listen actively to their presentation
- Cross off topics they cover
- Use remaining questions to fill gaps
- Have 1-2 backup questions ready

**Pro tip:**Â End with something like "You've covered most of what I was curious about. I'm particularly interested in [specific topic they mentioned] - could you tell me more about that?" This shows you were listening and helps create a conversation rather than an interrogation.

**Sample mini-format:**

```
ROLE: Daily tasks? Team size? Biggest challenges?
CULTURE: Work hours? Remote policy? Team collaboration?
GROWTH: Learning opportunities? Career progression?
BACKUP: What excites you about working here?
```

Having this safety net will boost your confidence and ensure you gather the information you need to make a good decision
