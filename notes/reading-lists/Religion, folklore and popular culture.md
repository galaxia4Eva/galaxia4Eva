## [Why Flashcards Beat Mnemonics for Studying - Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2023/06/06/flashcards-vs-mnemonics)
> - **It takes time to learn and teach mnemonic methods.** Unlike flashcards, mnemonics is itself a skill that requires considerable practice to get good at. While this may benefit elite mnemonists, it may not be worth the additional investment for those who simply want to learn Spanish, law or anatomy.
> - **Mnemonics often take a good deal of time, especially for beginners.** It may take a few minutes to create a good link with the keyword method, in which time you could have done several repetitions with flashcards. One study, which equalized the time-on-task between mnemonics and more rote memorization, found that simply increasing repetition provided an advantage over using the mnemonic.
> - **Mnemonics greatly assist with recall over relatively short intervals, but their benefits might not endure.** This makes mnemonics useful in memory competitions—events that require memorization of highly arbitrary information with near-immediate recall. In contrast, much of what we’re trying to memorize needs to stay in our heads for much longer.
> 
> **Direct Retrieval is the End Goal of Learning**
> 
> As expertise develops, more elaborate methods tend to be replaced by direct retrieval of the answer. This is one reason that expertise can be relatively effortless—instead of going through an elaborate process to get to an answer, you just remember it.
> 
> For situations where fluency is particularly important, such as recalling vocabulary words while speaking, the direct retrieval option is perhaps necessary for a majority of words in order to not get bogged down while speaking too much. This suggests that even if you initially learn a word via mnemonics, direct retrieval will eventually take over as it becomes the faster option.
