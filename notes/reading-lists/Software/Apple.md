> 
> THE DEAL
> --------
> As of 3.1.2, Xcode bundles a fork of an older version of distcc, 2.18.5-Apple.1.  Apple distcc has several changes that allow it to integrate well with Xcode, including Bonjour-based service advertisement, server capability querying, precompiled header support, and tweaks to handle some features unique to Apple gcc and how Xcode calls it.
> 
> distcc 2.18 is from the 2004 era, and distcc has been improved in the intervening five years.  Most notably, distcc 3 supports pump mode, which allows preprocessing to be offloaded to distccd servers instead of requiring that it always be done locally.
> 
> This project attempts to realign Apple distcc (including Apple-specific changes to distcc 2.18) with the current released version of distcc, 3.1, which includes pump mode.
