= An essay on an assumed ethics of a nuke.
== There is no amount of words that would justify burning millions of people alive.

There is no ethics in a nuke.
Were the opposite the case, russia would have never attacked Ukraine.
An armed robbery in a dark place has more ethics than a nuke could ever have.
Anything else is just soothing one's inner Oppenheimer.
There is no way to measure ethics, lest to say to measure it in kilotons or megatons.
Anything else is just soothing one's inner Oppenheimer with postâ€“rationalisations.

The rants we hear from kremlin in moscow about nuclear bombardment of the world into multipolarity, in my opinion, are signs of their stagnation: communism proved to have liquidity issues on the idealogical market, oil is not that scarce to give them a competitive edge.
So they try to assume a role of nuclear technology provider in a supposed multipolar world.
And they don't care if in a fight of converting arid Central Asia into a blooming paradise, say, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan convert their land into a nuclear desert.
Were the opposite the case, russia would have never attacked Ukraine.

There is no amount of words that would justify what russia did to Mariupol, Bucha, Izium and other Ukrainian towns and cities.
I dare to remind you, that cities and towns are not just buildings, infrastructure, streets and street names.
Cities and towns are people, their communities, their dreams and hopes.
People of russia brought the war in Ukraine by their choice and they should take the responsibility as for their actions and for their inaction as well.

An armed robbery in a dark place has more ethics than a nuke could ever have.
And it does not matter if a victim of a robbery in the question also carries a gun.
In the case, when the situation resolves in a way that everybody lives, the victim would call the police and the perpetrator will have to go in hiding from justice.
In the case when the situation results in a wounded, or even dead, body, the society will notice that and inform the police. And for the surviving party justice will be, according to the way situation had been resolved, more severe.

In a case when there were no police, no paramedics, no society, but only an armed perpetrator and, potentially an armed victim, whoever gets the bullet is most likely to bleed to death.
End of story, no morals, just some dead bodies and no ethics but direct, natural consequences of actions.
In this case, neither the victim nor the perpetrator are not necessary to be humans: direct, natural consequences work the same way for animals as for humans.
Also, there is no reason for the place of a robbery to be a dark one.

If Ukraine to have an ethical nuclear doctrine, it should not be directed to acquiring nuclear strike capabilities, but rather strive for the nuclear disarmament of russia, belarus, and any other party that violates, or enables a violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Anything else is a road to a nuclear desert.
